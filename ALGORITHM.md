Simplified version of the Anki algorithm.

- Cards start with a `factor` of 2.5 (250%)
- The first revision interval is 10 minutes, then 1 day, then according to the factor
- Factor adjustments happen in 0.15 (15%) increments or decrements
- The maximum factor is 13.
- After a lapse the intervals are 1 minute, 10 minutes, 1 day, according to factor
